-------------------------------------------------------------
v1.x.x and above tested under windows only (MD)

You need OpenCV Library.
Linux:
	OpenCV2.1 and OpenCV2.3 tested (v0.8.0)
Windows:
	OpenCV - see history
Modify Makefiles in order to use correct paths.

GCC under Linux or MinGW under Windows is suggested. But you can use
whichever compiler you want. Simply change things according to your
needs.
