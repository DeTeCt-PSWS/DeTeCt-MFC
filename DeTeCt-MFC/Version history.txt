===============================================================================================================
v3.2.2
Autostakkert:	wait for autostakkert to exit before finishing processings (zip, aso...)
Autostakkert:	Store impact detection folder and general logs within DeTeCt.exe folder
Autostakkert:	use as3 file for processing queue (to compute faster)
Algorithm:		red cross changed to yellow, Green to blue to see them better, and be color blind compliant (M. Lewis)
Logs:			do not zip / send email if no file has been processed
Logs:			renames logs with date-time min and max
Files:			do not add processed file (if -noreproc on) / file with too few frames / file with type to be ignored (dark, ...) to the processing list
WinJupos:		Reads xml derot configuration file
GUI:			Full interface with small logs
GUI:			Global progress bar
GUI:			Shows live # of null/low/high probability impacts processed
GUI:			Reset file list menu
Bugfix:			do not launch several DeTeCt instances if maxinstances = 1 even in non auto mode
Bugfix:			in automatic mode, exits if no valid file selected
Options:		Reads options from ini before interpreting command line options
General			Displays number of processors
Command:		add shorter names for all options
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.2.1
Detection:	rename output files with planet and dates of analysis
Detection:  button to opens explorer in the detection folder (systematic), on the zip file (depending on the generation), and send email (by default, but deactivable)
Detection:  messages in the final window to synthetize the resuts (no impact, low probablity, high probability)
Detection:  messages in the final window to push for analyzing images and sending email with zipfile
Parameters:	options to generate zip file and send email
Logs:		store .csv separately (S. Sylla)
Command line:-nozip option
Bugfix:		zip file empty in automatic mode (L.Keith)
Bugfix:		zip file empty when relative path use as parameter for directory or file
Bugfix:		*.exe file tested when detect exe launched without the upper cases
Bugfix:		accents (ie û) in directory name prevents image / directory creation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v3.2 (/v3.1.12):
Algorithm:		Check #of frames calculated from fps for impacts (duration 0.6s)
Detection:		use of multi criteria for impact detection (confidence, distance acceptable, "contrast" of detection image)
Detection:		messages and logs clarified (rating high, low, nul, error)
GUI:			Advanced settings window more alerting user, about box enriched
GUI:			Latest version menu
GUI:			Tutorial menu
GUI:			Documentation menu
GUI:			Reset preferences saves reset preferences
Parameters:		details deactivated by default
Log:			frame # of impact when detection in log (Sylla/Lewis)
Log:			addition of distance in logfile
Log:			addition of planet and min/max dates in logfilename in impact_detection folder (Lewis)
Log:			Creation by default of zipped impact_detection folder for sending (messages changed, checkbox added in advanced settings)
Files:			Displays file processed/total number of files to process in window
Command line:	-help option
Command line:	displaying messages at the initialization (-help, errors, ...)
Command line:	error message if folder or file from command line not found
Bugfix:			negative value for number of frames (error with _ftelli64)
Bugfix:			generation of max-mean non normalized value even if no detail option activated
Bugfix:			space in file/folder names from command line
Bugfix:			reinitialization of all parameters
Bugfix:			save all parameters in .ini (and remove crash)

v3.1.11:
General:	option for dark file usage (except on winjupos and pipp files)
Algorithm:	no logging of impacts when overal mean is too small (ie no planetary acquisition)
AS3:		using as3 with highest number of aligned frames in priority
AS3:		using WinJupos DRS if as3 uses unexisting derotated file
Files:		Ignore dark files (possibility to ignore PIPP or WJ derotation)
ROI:		ignoring pixels with small brightness for center of mass calculation
Algorithm:	decrease rejection of frames due to low mean of brightness
Algorithm: include in log all statistics about the mean/diff/detections images generated
Bugfix:		ROI not working if coordinates outside of range
Bugfix:		crash when erasing first file from file list in detection
Bugfix:		datation only mode not working and bad output for logfile pathname
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
